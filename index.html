        <pre style="font-size:150%;">
            Remember those walls I built
            Well baby they're tumbling down
            And they didn't even put up a fight
            They didn't even make a sound
            I found a way to let you in
            But I never really had a doubt
            Standing in the light of your halo
            I got my angel now

            It's like I've been awakened
            Every rule I had you breaking
            It's the risk that I'm taking
            I ain't never gonna shut you out

            Everywhere I'm looking now
            I'm surrounded by your embrace
            Baby I can see your halo
            You know you're my saving grace
            You're everything I need and more
            It's written all over your face
            Baby I can feel your halo
            Pray it won't fade away

            I can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo
            Can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo

            Hit me like a ray of sun
            Burning through my darkest night
            You're the only one that I want
            Think I'm addicted to your light
            I swore I'd never fall again
            But this don't even feel like falling
            Gravity can't forget
            To pull me back to the ground again

            Feels like I've been awakened
            Every rule I had you breaking
            It's the risk that I'm taking
            I'm never gonna shut you out

            Everywhere I'm looking now
            I'm surrounded by your embrace
            Baby I can see your halo
            You know you're my saving grace

            I can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo
            Can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo
            Ohhhh Halo
            Halo Ohhhhhhhhhhh

            Everywhere I'm looking now
            I'm surrounded by your embrace
            Baby I can see your halo
            You know you're my saving grace
            You're everything I need and more
            It's written all over your face
            Baby I can feel your halo
            Pray it won't fade away

            I can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo
            Can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo
            Can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo
            Can feel your halo, halo, halo
            Can see your halo, halo, halo
